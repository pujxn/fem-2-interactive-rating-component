1. linear-gradient that can be used with the background-image property to specify gradients in diff angles
2. svgs are xml, pretty cool
3. align works vertical, jsutify horizontal
4. adding borders to images will crop them, so to achieve something like you just did for the star, add a div, shape it and insert img in it
5. spans are inline elements and if they have content inside (text), they wilkl by default vertically align to the parent container's baseline/bottom with their baseline
6. if they have no baseline, then bottom to baseline. so to maker sure all spans stay in same line, vertical-align:top
7. spans cant have any top/bottom margins as they are inline
8. span display inline-flex exists. by default they arent inline, so make sure to change if you want
9. buttons have border by default
10. button hover doesnt automatically change cursor pointer, so need to change 'cursor' property
11. button can be styled like any other inline element, eg: span
